# Get info on a subreddit

To get info on a user, we are going to use the **/subreddit** command, which takes in a **subreddit \(string\)** parameter and nothing else.

{% hint style="info" %}
This command follows [nsfw content rules](../topics/nsfw.md)
{% endhint %}

You'll get back a subreddit info embed. Much like this
